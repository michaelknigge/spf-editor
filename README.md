# SPF-Editor (formely known as SPF/SE and SPF/365)

Powerful editor and file manager that emulates the IBM mainframe ISPF editor. The editor was developed by Tim Tetivia, who unfortunately died in 2022 as a result of a corona infection.

# Permission to distribute

Tim protected his development environment with technical tools. Unfortunately, nobody knew the access data (i. e. passwords) to his environment and so unfortunately nobody, not even members of his family, had access to the source code of the editor. With some research and help from other SPF users (namely Peter aka Verizon), it was possible to contact Tim's wife Bonnie. She gave us permission to distribute the editor for free. It should be in Tim's interest that his editor continues to be used.

> Yes, you can distribute Tim's SPF products for free. I'm not sure how you would do it. I'm sure he would like others to continue using the product.
> 
> As mentioned below I have no access to any software, macros, etc for the SPF products so am no help with installation or troubleshooting any problems.
> 
> Any questions please feel free to contact me.
