# SPF/SE 8.0
Version 8.0 was provided by a SPF/SE user - I've never used this release.

## License file.
To make the SPF/SE 8.0 release a full working release, you need a license file.
As we've got the permission to distribute SPF/SE for free, we can also make a [valid license file available](binaries/SPFLicense.dat).
Sadly the license is expired.

## Original releases
A custom installer, as for versions 6.0, 7.0 and 365, is not provided due to the fact that I can only provide an expired license. You can find the following 8.0 releases in the [binaries direcrtory](binaries).
